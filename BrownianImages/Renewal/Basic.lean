Modified, twice:
  1. the `import` lines were rewritten to the module paths of this project;
  2. the `Nonlattice` hypothesis was weakened to `FellerNonlattice`, which is what
     the proofs below actually consume.  `FellerNonlattice` and its almost everywhere
     consequence are defined in `Basic.lean`; the hypothesis is swapped in the
     declarations that merely forward it, `charFun_ne_one_of_nonlattice` is replaced by
     the corresponding field, and the one live use of the pointwise bound
     `norm_charFun_lt_one_of_nonlattice` becomes an almost everywhere statement inside
     the `filter_upwards` that consumes it.  `Nonlattice`,
     `charFun_ne_one_of_nonlattice`, `norm_charFun_lt_one_of_nonlattice` and
     `tendsto_charFun_pow_of_nonlattice` are kept unchanged.

# A renewal mini-library

Paper §7 concludes `lem:nd-gaussian-renewal` with the *key renewal theorem for
directly Riemann integrable functions on the whole line* (Feller, *An Introduction
to Probability Theory and its Applications* vol. 2, §XI.9 (9.2) and §XI.1
(1.10)--(1.17); Gut, *Stopped Random Walks*, Thm. 6.6 and Rem. 6.4).

Mathlib v4.32.0 contains **no renewal theory at all** — the identifiers
`renewal`, `Blackwell`, `directly Riemann`, `ladder` and `random walk` do not
occur anywhere in the library. It does, however, provide the convolution of
measures `MeasureTheory.Measure.conv` (notation `∗`, the pushforward of
`μ.prod ν` under `+`) together with associativity, commutativity, the `dirac 0`
unit laws, `SFinite`/`IsProbabilityMeasure` instances and the integral formulas
`MeasureTheory.integral_conv` / `Measure.lintegral_conv`. That is the substrate
this file is built on.

This module is deliberately a **leaf**: it depends only on Mathlib, never on the
rest of `AbsorptionCutoff`. The chapter-specific bridge — instantiating everything here
at the Cramér-tilted increment law `μ̂_{A,N}` — lives in
`AbsorptionCutoff.Supercritical.StationaryEquation`.

## Main definitions

* `Renewal.convPow`: the convolution power `μ^{*n}`, the law of the random walk
  step `S_n = Z_1 + ⋯ + Z_n`.
* `Renewal.renewalMeasure`: the renewal measure `U = ∑_{n ≥ 0} μ^{*n}`.
* `Renewal.abelRenewalMeasure`: the Abel-discounted renewal measure
  `U_r = ∑_{n ≥ 0} rⁿ μ^{*n}`, the regularization used to identify Blackwell's
  constant `1/m̂`.
* `Renewal.expTransform`: the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued exponential transform
  `∫ e^{-θz} dμ`, which turns convolution into multiplication.

## Main results

* `Renewal.renewalMeasure_le_of_expTransform`: the explicit geometric left-tail
  bound `U(s) ≤ e^{θb}/(1 - ∫ e^{-θz}dμ)` for `s ⊆ (-∞, b]`, from which
* `Renewal.renewalMeasure_lt_top_of_expTransform_lt_one` and
  `Renewal.renewalMeasure_Icc_lt_top`: local finiteness of `U`.
* `Renewal.driNorm`: the directly-Riemann-integrable norm
  `∑_{k∈ℤ} sup_{[k,k+1]} g`, and `Renewal.tsum_lintegral_comp_sub_le`: a uniform
  bound `C` on the `U`-mass of unit cells gives `∑ₙ∫g(y−s)dμ^{*n} ≤ C‖g‖_DRI`.
* `Renewal.lintegral_le_driNorm`: `‖·‖_{L¹} ≤ ‖·‖_DRI`, whence
  `Renewal.integrable_of_driNorm` and `Renewal.norm_integral_sub_le_driNorm`.
* `Renewal.exists_hasCompactSupport_driNorm_sub_lt`: a continuous kernel of
  finite d.R.i. norm is `‖·‖_DRI`-approximable by continuous compactly supported
  ones.
* `Renewal.summable_integral_comp_sub_of_driNorm` and
  `Renewal.norm_tsum_integral_comp_sub_sub_le`: the smoothed renewal series of a
  kernel with finite d.R.i. norm converges absolutely, and two kernels' series
  differ by at most `C‖z−w‖_DRI` uniformly in `y`.

## Development plan

1. the convolution power `μ^{*n}` and the renewal measure `U` (this file);
2. Blackwell's renewal theorem;
3. the key renewal theorem for directly Riemann integrable functions on the line;
4. the paper's abstract measure-valued form
   (`eq:nd-abstract-renewal-equation` → `eq:nd-abstract-renewal-limit`).

The smoothing kernel (`unitBox`, `triangle`, `sincSq` and their Fourier
identities) lives in the sibling leaf module
`AbsorptionCutoff.Supercritical.RenewalKernel`, split off purely for build time.

### The Abel-discounted renewal measure

Identifying Blackwell's constant `1/m̂` is done by *Abel regularization*: the
undiscounted resolvent `(1 - χ(-2πt))⁻¹` has a genuine pole at the origin, and a
symmetric principal-value treatment of it sees only half the boundary mass,
producing `1/(2m̂)`. Discounting by `rⁿ` for `0 < r < 1` moves the pole off the
real axis — `1 - rχ(-2πt)` is bounded away from zero — and the model denominator
`(1-r) + 2π i r m̂ t` has a *one-sided* exponential inverse transform, which is
what supplies the missing half. The limits are then taken in the order `r ↑ 1` at
fixed `y`, and only afterwards `y → ∞`; see `A4G4_BLACKWELL_PROOF_NOTE.tex` §3.

The discounted measure is scaled in `ℝ≥0∞`, so it stays a genuine (nonnegative)
measure and `abelRenewalMeasure_mono` holds. That monotonicity in `r` is not
cosmetic: it is what licenses monotone convergence from the discounted series
back to the actual renewal series at `r = 1`.

### Local finiteness of the renewal measure

For a general random walk drifting to `+∞`, local finiteness of `U` is proved by
a ladder-height decomposition. Here we do not need that generality: the increment
law the chapter supplies is the *Cramér tilt* `μ̂_{A,N}`, and the tilt comes with
a whole interval of finite exponential moments. Concretely, for
`0 < θ < β_{A,N}`,

  `∫ e^{-θ z} μ̂_{A,N}(dz) = ℳ_{A,N}(β_{A,N} - θ) < 1`,

the strict inequality being `gaussianTransferMoment_lt_one_of_lt_cramerExponent`
in `AbsorptionCutoff.Supercritical.StationaryEquation`. A Chernoff bound then makes the
convolution powers decay *geometrically* on every half-line `(-∞, b]`, so `U` is
finite there — much stronger than local finiteness, and enough for everything
downstream.

The transform is taken with values in `ℝ≥0∞` so that no integrability side
conditions are needed; the real-valued identification against `ℳ_{A,N}` is done
where the transform is applied.

This is the bridge from the *smoothed* renewal series — which the Abel argument
evaluates — back to the renewal measure of an actual interval, and hence the first
half of the uniform local bound. The comparison is done for each convolution power
separately: `c·μ^{*n}(I) ≤ ∫_I v(y−z)dμ^{*n} ≤ ∫ v(y−z)dμ^{*n}`, the second step
using `v ≥ 0`. Summing needs `ENNReal.ofReal_tsum_of_nonneg` to move the whole

/-- **The companion comparison, in the other direction**: a kernel dominated by an
indicator has smoothed renewal series below the renewal measure,

`∑ₙ ∫w(y−z)dμ^{*n} ≤ U({z : y−z ∈ I})`  whenever `w ≤ 1_I` pointwise.

Together with `renewalMeasure_le_ofReal_tsum_integral` these are the two halves of
the sandwich that turns Blackwell's theorem for smooth kernels into Blackwell's
theorem for intervals: a lower kernel `w⁻ ≤ 1_I` bounds `U` from below and an
upper kernel `w⁺ ≥ 1_I` bounds it from above.

Stated in `ℝ` under a finiteness hypothesis on `U` (available eventually from
A-4e) rather than in `ℝ≥0∞`. That is deliberate: `w` here is *signed* — a
bandlimited kernel below an indicator must go negative outside `I` — so the terms
`∫w(y−z)dμ^{*n}` need not be nonnegative and `ENNReal.ofReal` would not commute
with the sum. Comparing partial sums in `ℝ` and passing to the limit avoids the
issue entirely. -/

### Nonlatticeness and the characteristic function

The chosen proof route for Blackwell's theorem is Fourier inversion against
smoothing kernels with compactly supported Fourier transform (see
`A4G4_BLACKWELL_PROOF_NOTE.tex`). Nonlatticeness enters that argument
at exactly one point, and in exactly one form: the characteristic function
`χ(t) = ∫ e^{itz} dμ` must avoid the value `1` off the origin, so that
`1 - χ` is bounded away from `0` on the compact set where the transform of the
smoothing kernel lives.
-/

/-- A probability measure on `ℝ` is **nonlattice** when it is not concentrated on
any arithmetic progression `a + rℤ`.

This is stated in exactly the form the chapter supplies it: the tilted increment
law `μ̂_{A,N}` satisfies it by
`tiltedIncrementLaw_not_concentrated_on_lattice`. Note the degenerate case
`r = 0` is included, and forces `μ` to be atomless at every point. -/
def Nonlattice (μ : Measure ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a r : ℝ, μ {x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = a + k * r} ≠ 1

/-- **Feller's non-lattice condition**, which is what the proofs below actually consume.
`Nonlattice` is strictly stronger: it fails for every law carried by finitely many atoms,
while this one holds as soon as the atoms lie on no lattice through the origin. -/

lattice `(2π/t) ℤ`, contradicting `Nonlattice`. -/

The Fourier proof of Blackwell's theorem integrates `(1 - charFun μ t)⁻¹` against
the transform of the smoothing kernel, which is supported in a compact interval

on the remaining compact annulus `δ ≤ |t| ≤ T` this lemma keeps it bounded.
Nonlatticeness enters only through `charFun_ne_one_of_nonlattice`, and
compactness upgrades the pointwise nonvanishing to a uniform bound. -/

### The pole at the origin

`(1 - charFun μ t)⁻¹` blows up at `t = 0`; that pole is precisely what carries
the `1/m̂` of Blackwell's theorem. The three lemmas below quantify it. They are
the only place where the **deliberate hypothesis strengthening** `MemLp id 2 μ`
(a finite second moment, where sharp Feller needs only a finite mean) is used;
`μ̂_{A,N}` has exponential moments, so it costs nothing at the instantiation.

/-- **A nonlattice probability measure has `‖charFun μ t‖ < 1` for every `t ≠ 0`**
— strictly stronger than `charFun_ne_one_of_nonlattice`, and what the `N → ∞`
passage in Blackwell's proof needs: it is what makes `χ(t)^N → 0` pointwise off
the origin.

`‖χ(t)‖ = 1` forces `χ(t) = e^{iθ}` for `θ = arg χ(t)`; rotating by `e^{-iθ}` and
taking real parts gives `∫(1 - cos(tz - θ))dμ = 0`, so `μ` is carried by the
*coset* `θ/t + (2π/t)ℤ`. This is exactly why `Nonlattice` quantifies over the
shift `a` as well as the span `r`: without the shift, this argument would not
close. -/

### The Parseval atom

The workhorse of the Fourier route: convolving a measure with a test function
whose Fourier transform is integrable turns the measure into its characteristic
function. Applied to `ν = μ^{*n}` and summed over `n` — where `charFun_conv`
makes `charFun (μ^{*n}) = (charFun μ)^n` — this is what converts the renewal
measure into the resolvent `(1 - χ)⁻¹` whose pole at the origin carries the
`1/m̂` of Blackwell's theorem.

Mathlib's Fourier convention carries the `2π` in the exponent
(`𝓕 w t = ∫ e^{-2πi t x} w x dx`), while `charFun` does not
(`charFun ν s = ∫ e^{isz} dν`), whence the argument `-(2π t)` below. Both
conventions are kept as they are: `𝓕` is what the inversion theorem and the
Riemann–Lebesgue lemma are stated for, and `charFun` is what `charFun_conv`
is stated for.
-/

/-- **Parseval / inversion for a probability measure against a test function.**

For a test function `w` that is continuous and integrable with integrable Fourier
transform,
`∫ w(y - z) dν(z) = ∫ 𝓕w(t) e^{2πity} χ_ν(-2πt) dt`,
where `χ_ν = charFun ν`. Fourier inversion inside the `ν`-integral, then Fubini
(legitimate because `‖e^{iθ}‖ = 1` and `ν` is finite, so the joint integrand is
dominated by `‖𝓕w(t)‖`). -/

/-- **The `N → ∞` passage in the truncated Parseval identity.**

For a *difference* kernel `w` — one whose transform is supported in `[-T,T]` and
vanishes to first order at the origin, `‖𝓕w(t)‖ ≤ L|t|` — the partial sums of the
smoothed renewal series converge to the resolvent integral

`∑_{n<N} ∫ w(y−z) μ^{*n}(dz) → ∫ 𝓕w(t) e^{2πity} (1 − χ(−2πt))⁻¹ dt`.

Dominated convergence. Off the origin `‖χ‖ < 1`
(`norm_charFun_lt_one_of_nonlattice`), so the geometric partial sums converge
pointwise to `(1 − χ)⁻¹`; the origin is a null set. The dominator is the *constant*
`2C` on `[-T,T]` and `0` outside: `‖∑_{n<N} χⁿ‖ ≤ 2/‖1 − χ‖` by `geom_sum_eq`
together with `‖χ^N‖ ≤ 1`, while `‖𝓕w(t)‖ ≤ C‖1 − χ‖` by
`exists_norm_fourier_le_norm_one_sub_charFun`, and the pole cancels. This is
precisely where the first-order vanishing of `𝓕w` is indispensable: for a general
kernel the limit integrand behaves like `1/(m̂|t|)` near `0`, which is not
integrable in one dimension. -/

### The directly-Riemann-integrable norm and the cell error estimate

The key renewal theorem is proved here by *approximation in the d.R.i. norm*
rather than by Feller's route through Blackwell's interval theorem. The whole
mechanism is one inequality: if the renewal measure of every unit cell is at most
`C`, then the entire smoothed renewal series of a kernel `g` is at most
`C · ‖g‖_DRI`, where

  `‖g‖_DRI := ∑_{k ∈ ℤ} sup_{[k, k+1]} g`.

Applied to `g = |z − w|` this bounds the error made by replacing a d.R.i. kernel
`z` with a bandlimited approximation `w`; applied to `g = |z|` it gives absolute
convergence of the series itself.

Everything here is stated in `ℝ≥0∞`, where suprema and sums are total and the
inequality needs no integrability, measurability or finiteness hypotheses at all.
The real-valued consequences are extracted at the point of use.

tail, so the truncation error can be made arbitrarily small in `‖·‖_DRI`.

Reduced to `ENNReal.tendsto_tsum_compl_atTop_zero`, whose index filter is
`atTop` over *finite sets* of `ℤ`; the bridge is that any finite `S ⊆ ℤ` is

`g` there by its cell supremum, and bound each cell's `U`-mass by `C`. Nothing

approximation `w` perturbs the smoothed renewal series by at most `C‖z−w‖_DRI`,
*uniformly in `y`*.

This is the entire mechanism of the minimal route to the key renewal theorem. The
limit `(∫z)/m̂` is known for bandlimited `w` and `∫w → ∫z` is controlled by the
same norm, so a d.R.i. `z` is squeezed onto its limit by approximating in
`‖·‖_DRI` — with no interval Blackwell and no pointwise sandwich, which is what
makes the pointwise lower kernel (the one obstruction that cannot be built)
unnecessary. -/
