# Run the comparator audit of the proved endpoints: the statements frozen in
# Challenge.lean, proved in Solution.lean, with the audited names listed in

#
# Requires local builds of leanprover/comparator and of leanprover/lean4export
# at the project's Lean version (v4.32.2); override the default locations with
# COMPARATOR_TOOLS or the individual variables below. landrun is Linux-only,
# so on macOS comparator's shim is used and the builds run unsandboxed. To add
# the independent nanoda kernel, build it with cargo, set COMPARATOR_NANODA to
# the binary, and set "enable_nanoda": true in comparator-config.json.
